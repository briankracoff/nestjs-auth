 * Handlers decorated with `AuthnOptional` may or may not have a full identity
 * passed to their `@Identity` parameter. If the user _is_ logged in, then the
 * handler receives a full identity: principal, credential, and scopes. If the
 * user is not logged in, then the handler receives an _anonymous_ identity.
 * The principal and credential are undefined; the scopes are whatever you've
 * set as the application's anonymous scopes.
 *
 * This differs from `AuthSkip` in that if you send _bad_ auth,
 * `AuthOptional` will fail and `AuthnSkip` will succeed
 *
 * Formally, the @Identity parameter should take as a type something that looks
 * like `IdentityBill<TPrincipal, TCredential> | AnonymousBill`.
